                                        I am a graduate of medical engineering from Tehran Azad University. <br>
                                        I wasn't very interested in my field of study and that's why I didn't work in this field <br>
                                        The university taught me many lessons and helped me become more social. <br>
                                        At the same time as I was studying, I worked round the clock in a pharmacy <br>
                                        and after one year I started working in a real estate office <br>
                                        and working in these two places made me Strong in negotiation and speech skills
                                        it's true ! <br> I am  <br>

                                    When I graduated from university and worked in several places, and after my money ran out on the 20th of every month,
                                    I decided to look for a second job.
                                    Unfortunately, in Iran, you don't have many choices to earn money
                                    The only solution is to create a business for yourself!
                                    So Tada!!! Trading gives you an opportunity to come out of the situation you are in proudly
                                    so I got into it after learning how to do it, and I have been making money this way for several months now!! <br>
                                    LUCKY ME !
